## Generating Thumbnails

In order to generate Thumbnails you need to:

1. Specify what kind of thumbnails you need by creating a Task. Each task should have a name, a path to folder with images and a number of options;
2. Put an image into the platform blob storage;
3. Run the selected Task. Tasks are executed in the background job with hangfire.

The system will generate all thumbnails in the folder according to your options.

The thumbnail url is obtained by adding a suffix to the original image url separated by "_" symbol.

In order to create a task open the Thumbnails menu and click the 'Add' button on the Tasks blade:

In order to edit or manage the thumbnails settings, select an option from the list and click on it. The system will display the option on a new blade in editable format:

**4. "Crop" method.**

This method resizes the image until one of the sides matches the given dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio. A part of the image will be cut off. The thumbnail will be resized and cropped according to the anchor position. You can specify an anchor position in the o'sption Anchor Position: TopLeft, TopCenter, TopRight, CenterLeft, Center, CenterRight, BottomLeft, BottomCenter, BottomRight.
